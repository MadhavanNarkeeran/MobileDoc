# CMSC436 Project Proposal: Mobile Doc

## Project Team

 * Elliott Eager  
 * Madhavan Narkeeran  
 * Jason Firestein  

## App Description

Mobile Doc is an app designed to help patients efficiently manage their healthcare by keeping all essential medical information in one place. Users can register and securely log in to access a personalized dashboard that allows them to track their doctors, appointments, prescriptions, lab results, and billing information.

## Minimal Goals

The app will contain the following main features:

### User Authentication and Access Control
 * Users can register and log in securely.
 * Each user has personalized access to manage their doctors and medical records.

### Dashboard (Home Page)
 * Displays all added doctors with relevant details.
 * Calendar for tracking appointments.
 * Notifications for upcoming appointments, lab results, and other medical updates.

### Doctor Management
 * Users can add doctors to their profile.
 * A dedicated "All Doctors" page lists all doctors added by the user.

### Prescription Section
 * Includes information about specific medications, dosage, and instructions for use.
 * Provides links to pharmacy options for prescription fulfillment.

### Camera Integration for Document Uploads
 * Users can use their mobile device's camera to take pictures of prescriptions, medical documents, and insurance cards.
 * Uploaded images are stored securely in the app for easy access.
 * Allows users to attach images to doctor profiles or prescription records for quick reference.

## Stretch Goals

We have identified the following stretch goals:

 * A scanner feature that allows users to scan and store their insurance cards for easy access.
